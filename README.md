# Hello-World

Hello World! 

My name is Matthijs, completely new to programming. 
I am currently looking to start programming and I understand the best way to do that, is by tackling or creating a project of your own. 

I decided to try to create a cryptocurrency tracker with Python, but this is solely based upon internet research and limited programming knowledge. 

I am very open to feedback; if you have any remarks, comments or tips on the feasibility of my project or in general, please tell me so. 

Cheers!
